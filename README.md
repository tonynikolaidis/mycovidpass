myGreenPass is a simple app that stores EU Digital Green Certificates digitally.

### About this app

To save your certificate on the app, you can either scan its QR code or import the PDF file.

After the QR code has been decoded, a preview of the pass will appear displaying all details of the certificate and the option to save it.

After saving, the digital pass will be added to the app's home screen.

The generated pass shows all crucial information of the certificate such as the name of the holder and for example for the case of a test, the date that the test took place.

Tapping on the digital pass will open the details page, where all information stored in the QR code is displayed in a tidy manner and the option to delete the pass is present. Deleting a pass means that it is completely removed from the device.

Furthermore, tapping the QR code on the pass will enlarge it to make it easier to scan.

## What's new

- Fixed QR code size of PCR tests.
- Increased minimum Android version to 6.0.
